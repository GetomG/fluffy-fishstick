1258,18717,7,"Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can’t stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I’m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.",0,2,2,3,7,250

1234,18134,7,Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should’nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.,1,2,2,2,7,180

You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park ride’s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed.
