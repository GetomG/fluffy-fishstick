We were in the back of the whole part, called \u201cThe dead zone\u201d, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say \u201cwere going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn\u2019t have any mechanical problems.\u201d That\u2019s when my cousins went off.

There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didn\u2019t understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away\u2026 and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders.
