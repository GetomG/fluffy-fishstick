If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can\u2019t stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I\u2019m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Ideas': 0, 'Organization': 2, 'Style': 2, 'Conventions': 3}"}]}

I love you!\u201d @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated \u201c@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment\u201d @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother\u2019s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, \u201c@CAPS12, why don\u2019t you play with little @PERSON4?\u201d @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting \u201clittle\u201d @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they\u2019ve asked to play \u201cone\u201d for the billionth time. \u201c@CAPS2 we need to talk.\u201d @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,\u201d honey, you\u2019ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!\u201d @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4.

Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn\u2019t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn\u2019t get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don\u2019t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Ideas': 3, 'Organization': 3, 'Style': 3, 'Conventions': 3}"}]}

I learned this during a visit to the dentist\u2019s office. This @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl\u2019s tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didn\u2019t it was fair that I had to wait another @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn\u2019t mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Ideas': 3, 'Organization': 3, 'Style': 3, 'Conventions': 3}"}]}

I don\u2019t have any patients in grocery shopping I can\u2019t wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can\u2019t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don\u2019t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you.
